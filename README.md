# Awesome TLA [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

&gt; A curated list of Total Learning Architecture (TLA) resources, implementations, tools, standards, and
community projects

The Total Learning Architecture (TLA) originated from the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced
Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative and has transitioned to IEEE LTSC for formal standardization. TLA
encompasses multiple interconnected standards enabling organizations to build interoperable, adaptive
learning systems.
